Grocery Store Sales Analysis
Overview
This project involves analyzing sales data for a grocery store. The data is provided in the form of two images, which contain instructions and SQL queries to perform various data analysis tasks.
Data Overview
The data is stored in a products table, which contains the following columns:

product_type: The type of product (e.g., Snacks, Produce, Dairy)
min_price: The minimum price for the product type
max_price: The maximum price for the product type
weight: The weight of the product
price: The price of the product

Tasks
Task 1
Write a SQL query to retrieve the product_type, MIN(price) AS min_price, and MAX(price) AS max_price from the products table, grouped by product_type.
sqlCopySELECT
  product_type,
  MIN(price) AS min_price,
  MAX(price) AS max_price
FROM products
GROUP BY product_type;
Task 2
Write a SQL query to retrieve the median weight and median price of the products.
sqlCopySELECT
  CAST(REGEXP_REPLACE(weight, '[^0-9.]+', '', 'g') AS NUMERIC) AS weight,
  price::NUMERIC AS price
FROM products
WHERE weight IS NOT NULL AND price IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY weight, price
LIMIT 1 OFFSET (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM products WHERE weight IS NOT NULL) / 2,
LIMIT 1 OFFSET (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM products WHERE price IS NOT NULL) / 2;
Task 3
Write a SQL query to retrieve the product_type, MIN(price) AS min_price, and MAX(price) AS max_price from the products table, grouped by product_type.
sqlCopySELECT
  product_type,
  MIN(price) AS min_price,
  MAX(price) AS max_price
FROM products
GROUP BY product_type;
Challenges and Considerations

The data may contain missing or invalid values, which would need to be handled appropriately.
The performance of the queries may need to be optimized, especially for large datasets.
Additional data validation and cleaning may be required to ensure the integrity of the analysis.
Consideration should be given to how the results of the analysis will be presented and used by stakeholders.

Next Steps

Implement the SQL queries and test them with sample data.
Identify any edge cases or data quality issues that need to be addressed.
Explore additional analysis opportunities, such as trends over time or cross-product comparisons.
Develop visualizations or reports to effectively communicate the insights from the data.
